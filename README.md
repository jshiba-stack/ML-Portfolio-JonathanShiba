## Featured Projects  

### 1. EEG Signal Preprocessing & BCI Neural Decoding
  - Applied **bandpass (8â€“30 Hz) and notch (60 Hz) filtering** to clean noisy EEG signals.  
  - Visualized frequency components using **FFT & Power Spectral Density (PSD)**.  
  - Identified and interpolated noisy channels for **real-time BCI readiness**.  
  - **Stack**: Python, MNE-Python, NumPy, Matplotlib.  
[View Project](./EEG_BCI_Signal_Processing/README.md)
  
### 2. Card Image Classifier
  Trained a **convolutional neural network (CNN)** in PyTorch to classify playing card images from a Kaggle dataset.  
  - Implemented **data preprocessing & augmentation** pipelines.  
  - Designed & trained a CNN for **multi-class image recognition**.  
  - Strengthened skills in **model evaluation & architecture design**.  
  - **Stack**: Python, PyTorch, Torchvision, Matplotlib.
