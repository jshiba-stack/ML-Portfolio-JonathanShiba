# Playing Card Visual Classifier

This project trains a PyTorch convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify playing card images from a Kaggle dataset.

## Goals
- Build a supervised learning pipeline using PyTorch
- Practice image preprocessing, augmentation, and evaluation
- Strengthen model design and training workflow in PyTorch

## Tools Used
- Python, PyTorch, torchvision, matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Highlights
- CNN trained on multi-class image dataset
- Reinforced understanding of architecture design and evaluation metrics
- Dataset download: !kaggle datasets download -d gpiosenka/cards-image-datasetclassification
